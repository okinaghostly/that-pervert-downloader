# that-pervert-downloader
Made to batch download images from thatpervert

To run this code, you need to have Python on your machine. You may also need to install the additional libraries, which are "requests", "bs4", "os", "urllib", "time" and "re."

In the links.txt file, you put all the links with the images you want to download. The folder name is created based on the tag, so if it is long and difficult to read, the code may get confused with the folder name.

The file names are organized in order

The code is not downloading gifs the last time I looked, I could fix it but I won't, I'm too lazy right now.
